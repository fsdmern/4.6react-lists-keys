React List & Keys
===================
Generally data exists in the form of List
We may also require to transform the incoming data before rending
a. Numbers may be transformed using arithmetic operators
b. Strings may be transformed usin concatenate, substr, trim spaces etc.,
c. Lists are looped through and transformed and further rendered to the user

Keys:
=====
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added or removed
Therefore, Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give elements a stable identify
a. number itself can be passed as a key <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
b. another way is: <li key={number.id}>{number}</li>
c. least preferred alternative if we dont have unique id in the list:
<li key={index}>{number}</li>
